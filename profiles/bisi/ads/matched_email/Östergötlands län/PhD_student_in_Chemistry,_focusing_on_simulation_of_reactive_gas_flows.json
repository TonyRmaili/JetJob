        "text": "We have the power of over 40,000 students and co-workers. Students who provide hope for the future. Co-workers who contribute to Linköping University meeting challenges of today. Our fundamental values rest on credibility, trust and security. By having the courage to think freely and innovate, our actions together, large and small, contribute to a better world. We look forward to receiving your application!\nYour work assignments\nAs a PhD student, you devote most of your time to doctoral studies and the research projects of which you are part. Your work may also include teaching or other departmental duties, up to a maximum of 20 per cent of full-time.\n\nYour research focus will be on models and simulations of reactive gas flows, with applications in thin film depositions.\n\nThin films form the basis for all electronic devices, make cutting tools last longer, and prevent food from being spoiled. One of the main technologies for making thin films is chemical vapor deposition (CVD) which is based on a flow of reactive gases containing the atoms needed for the film material. The gases undergo chemical reactions, leading to products that react with the surface, depositing the atoms that build the material.\n\nNew CVD processes are mainly developed by trial-and-error. Models and computational simulations are used to improve our understanding of the complex CVD process, but there are many challenges in this, including the large range in both time and length scales, from the atomic dimensions and nanosecond-fast chemical reaction rates to the meter-sized reactor and relatively slow gas flow velocity.\n\nYour research project aims at improving existing methods and exploring new ways to efficiently and systematically model and simulate all aspects of CVD processes. The basis for this will be Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD), including chemical reaction models, but could also involve other modeling methods such as Density Functional Theory (DFT) or kinetic Monte Carlo.\n\nYour qualifications\nYou have graduated at Master’s level in engineering, applied physics, materials chemistry, physical chemistry or similar subject areas, or completed courses with a minimum of 240 credits, at least 60 of which must be in advanced courses in engineering, physics or chemistry. Alternatively, you have gained essentially corresponding knowledge in another way.\n\nExperience with Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) is a must, and knowledge of quantum chemical calculations (DFT) is advantageous. An interest in machine learning and AI-based methods, as well as programming skills in languages such as Python or MATLAB/Simulink, is beneficial.\n\nResearch at IFM is primarily conducted in English in an international environment, so a good ability to express yourself in spoken and written English is required. Equivalent knowledge in Swedish is advantageous.\n\nGood collaboration skills and a structured working approach are important for the role, and you should be independent with your own drive and interest in the research assignment. Great emphasis will be placed on personal qualities and suitability.\n\nYour workplace\n\nThe position is placed at the Division of Chemistry at the Department of Physics, Chemistry and Biology. The division carries out research, undergraduate education, and postgraduate education within biochemistry, molecular biotechnology, organic chemistry, analytical chemistry, chemical engineering, inorganic chemistry, and physical chemistry, particularly computational chemistry. Collaborations between different divisions and between departments are common.\n\nYou will work in a team with both experimentalists and theoreticians with access to several deposition systems, instruments for material analyses and high-performance computing resources at the Swedish National Supercomputer Centre.\n\nYou will be part of the graduate school Agora Materiae, which brings together around 50 doctoral students in materials research at LiU. In Agora Materiae, you will have the opportunity to meet other research students, exchange experiences, and create new contacts. You will participate in study visits both in Sweden and abroad, summer conferences, monthly seminars, and courses offered by the graduate school.\n\nLinköping University (LiU) conducts world-leading interdisciplinary research in areas such as materials science, IT, and life science technology. LiU is one of the largest universities in Sweden, with 40,000 students and 4,500 employees. The students are among the most sought after in the job market, and international rankings consistently place LiU as a leading global university. Read more at www.liu.se\n\nThe employment\n\nWhen taking up the post, you will be admitted to the program for doctoral studies. More information about the doctoral studies at each faculty is available at Doctoral studies at Linköping University\n\nThe employment has a duration of normally four years’ full-time equivalent. Extension of employment up to five years is based on the degree of teaching and institutional assignment. Further extensions may be granted in exceptional circumstances. You will initially be employed for one year, after which your employment will be renewed for a maximum of two years at a time, depending on your progress through the study plan. \n\nStarting date by agreement.\n\n \n\nSalary and employment benefits\n\nThe salary of PhD students is determined according to a locally negotiated salary progression.\n\nMore information about employment benefits at Linköping University is available here.\n\nUnion representatives\nInformation about union representatives, see Help for applicants.\n\nApplication procedure\n\nApply for the position by clicking the “Apply” button below. Your application must reach Linköping University no later than 24th of June 2025.\n\nApplications and documents received after the date above will not be considered.\n\nWe welcome applicants with different backgrounds, experiences and perspectives - diversity enriches our work and helps us grow. Preserving everybody's equal value, rights and opportunities is a natural part of who we are. Read more about our work with: Equal opportunities.\n\n\n\n\nWe look forward to receiving your application!\n\n\n\n\n\nLinköping university has framework agreements and wishes to decline direct contacts from staffing- and recruitment companies as well as vendors of job advertisements.",
