I am excited to apply for the Python Developer role at SwedQ, which I discovered through your recent job advertisement. The opportunity to shape my own role within a company that values innovation, independence, and continuous growth aligns perfectly with my career goals and hands-on approach to AI-driven software development.

With a background in machine learning, Python programming, and automation, I have worked extensively on projects involving large language models, fine-tuning, and prompt engineering, particularly leveraging OpenAI’s API and Azure OpenAI services. My experience includes building robust backend systems for structured data generation, developing user-friendly automation tools, and integrating AI into applications ranging from GUIs to game development. I am comfortable navigating REST APIs, managing JSON processing, and handling multi-modal AI tasks across text, image, and audio domains.

While my primary expertise is in Python, I am eager to further expand my skills in cloud technologies such as AWS and Azure, and I have experience deploying solutions using these platforms. I thrive in collaborative, diverse environments where curiosity and accountability are encouraged—qualities that seem to be at the heart of SwedQ’s culture. Creating solutions that deliver tangible value to clients motivates me, and your focus on designing roles around each consultant’s passions is particularly appealing.

I am enthusiastic about contributing to SwedQ’s dynamic team and would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my background and drive for continuous learning can help deliver innovative results for your clients. I am available for an interview at your convenience and look forward to connecting further.
