I’m an AI software developer with a background in machine learning, Python programming, and automation. I’ve worked on projects involving large language models (LLMs), fine-tuning, and prompt engineering—particularly using OpenAI’s API and Azure OpenAI services. My focus has been on generating structured JSON outputs, building AI-powered task automation systems, and developing tools for training data production.

Beyond backend development, I’ve also built GUIs using Tkinter and worked on integrating AI in game development using Pygame. I’m detail-oriented, comfortable with JSON processing, REST APIs, and handling multi-modal AI tasks including text, image, and audio. I enjoy building tools that are both functional and user-friendly, and I often explore ways to improve LLM reasoning through better system prompts and chain-of-thought logic.

I’m continuously expanding my skills, and I’m looking for opportunities where I can contribute to innovative AI-driven solutions in a practical, hands-on way.
