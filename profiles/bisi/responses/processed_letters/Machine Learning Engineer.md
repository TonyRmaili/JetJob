I am very interested in the Machine Learning Engineer position in Stockholm, which I found through your recent job posting. With a strong foundation in Python programming, machine learning, and scalable AI systems, I believe my experience aligns well with the requirements of this assignment.

Over the past several years, I have worked as an AI software developer, focusing on projects that combine robust backend engineering with advanced machine learning techniques. My hands-on experience includes building and fine-tuning large language models, developing production-ready AI tools, and integrating models into live environments using APIs and automation frameworks. I am particularly skilled in generating structured outputs, designing intelligent task automation systems, and supporting the full lifecycle of ML solutions—from data processing and model selection to deployment and monitoring.

I am comfortable working with both structured and unstructured data at scale, and have a track record of building reusable components and internal tools to accelerate ML workflows. My background includes experience with REST APIs, containerization, and cloud platforms—primarily Azure, but I am eager to expand into GCP and am prepared to obtain certification as required. I have also collaborated in agile, cross-functional teams, working closely with data scientists and engineers to deliver practical, maintainable systems.

I am motivated by opportunities to contribute hands-on to innovative, production-scale AI solutions, and I look forward to discussing how my skills can support the goals of Rasulson Consulting’s clients. I am available for interviews at your convenience and am ready to relocate onsite in Stockholm as needed.
