    "text": "I am very interested in the Senior Data Engineer position with GCP Certification at your global company in Stockholm, which I found through your recent job posting. My background as an AI software developer, with a strong focus on Python programming, automation, and machine learning, aligns well with the technical requirements and ambitions outlined in the role.\n\nOver several years, I have developed, deployed, and maintained data-driven solutions, primarily working with large language models, structured data pipelines, and automation tools. My experience includes designing robust backend systems, building APIs, and ensuring data integrity for AI-powered applications. I am highly proficient in Python and comfortable with a range of data formats, including JSON and various serialization protocols. I have also worked with REST APIs, multi-modal data processing, and cloud-based AI services, particularly leveraging automation and infrastructure-as-code principles.\n\nWhile my recent projects have centered on AI, task automation, and data-centric programming, I am eager to apply my skills in a broader Data Engineering context—especially within a team focused on building scalable and high-quality data products. I have a strong interest in the Data Mesh concept and am motivated by the opportunity to help shape data solutions that are secure, observable, and independently deployable. My approach is detail-oriented and collaborative, and I value continuous improvement and technical excellence.\n\nI am enthusiastic about joining a global, data-driven organization and contributing to your data transformation journey. I am available for interviews at your convenience and look forward to discussing how my hands-on experience and passion for data can support your team’s goals.",
