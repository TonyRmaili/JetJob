        "text": "Research shows that women and other under-represented groups within our industry hesitate to apply unless they tick most boxes of a role description. At Stegra, we are building an impact company with sustainability at its core. We need a diverse, inclusive, and authentic team to rally behind our purpose of de-carbonizing hard-to-abate industries, starting with steel. \nSo, if you are equally passionate about our purpose yet concerned that your experience doesn’t perfectly align with the qualifications stated in the job advert, we strongly encourage you to apply anyway. You may be just the right candidate, either for this role – or for another upcoming role in our rapidly growing business. \nAbout us \nStegra is on a mission to disrupt the global steel industry by producing green steel, with the end goal of bringing down CO emissions to zero. By using green hydrogen and fossil-free electricity instead of coal, our primary emissions will be water and heat. By 2030, our ambition is to produce 5 million tonnes of green steel annually in our fully integrated, digitalized, and sustainable plant in Boden, northern Sweden – currently under construction. But this is just the beginning – our expertise in green hydrogen will enable us to decarbonize other industries as well. \nWe are looking for talented, innovative, and purpose-driven people to join our rapidly growing and diverse team. Our employees get to learn every day, implement the latest technology, and put their ideas into practice. Together, we are building an impact company with sustainability at its core – for our people, customers, investors, society, and planet. \nAbout the role \nAs a Digital Workplace Technician Intern, you’ll play a key role in delivering a high-quality support experience for colleagues at Stegra. This hands-on internship offers the opportunity to work with modern tools and systems that enable and improve everyday work across the company. \nYou’ll be the first point of contact at our Digi Bars – walk-in tech support hubs – and support a wide range of digital tools and services. But this role goes beyond troubleshooting. You’ll also help develop smart automations, improve support processes, and create helpful content for users. Together with cross-functional teams, you’ll contribute to building a digital workplace that is efficient, inclusive, and enjoyable. \nWe are hiring 3 interns: \n 1 based in Stockholm until August 2026 \n  1 based in Boden until August 2026 \n  1 based in Boden until January 2026\n \n \nKey Responsibilities \n Provide expert in-person and remote support via Digi Bars, Slack, and ticketing systems \n  Troubleshoot and resolve issues across Microsoft 365, Slack, Zoom, Windows, macOS, and network access \n  Manage device logistics and support onboarding/offboarding workflows \n  Analyze support data and propose improvements \n  Build automations and enhance self-service tools \n  Deliver micro-learning content (e.g., tips, live walk-throughs) \n  Create and maintain user-facing documentation and training materials \n  Collect feedback and share insights with the broader team \n  Mentor new team members and support team knowledge building\n \nQualifications \nYou don’t need to meet every point below, but we’re looking for candidates with many of these skills and experiences: \n A degree in IT, Computer Science, or equivalent hands-on experience \n  Previous experience in IT support or a user-facing technical role \n  Comfortable working on-site at either our Stockholm office or Boden site, as you’ll be the first point of contact \n  Strong English communication skills (written and spoken) \n  Experience supporting hybrid workplaces with tools like Microsoft 365, Slack, Zoom, Zoom Rooms \n  Ability to create clear, engaging user guides, FAQs, or training content \n  Troubleshooting experience with Windows, macOS, and digital collaboration tools \n  Familiarity with scripting (PowerShell, Python) and APIs \n  Experience with ITSM platforms and analyzing support data\n \nPersonal qualities \nYou’re organized, curious, and reliable, with a passion for improving how people work. You enjoy solving problems and helping others, and you communicate clearly and empathetically. You thrive in fast-paced environments and bring a positive, user-focused mindset to everything you do. \nLocation: Stockholm or Boden\nApplications will be reviewed continuously, so we encourage you to apply as soon as possible. Instead of uploading a cover letter, we would like you to answer some questions. You will see these questions when you apply for the role.",
