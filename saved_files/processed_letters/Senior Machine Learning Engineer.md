I am excited to apply for the Senior Machine Learning Engineer position with the Music Experience team at Soundtrack, which I found on your careers page. The opportunity to work on end-to-end machine learning solutions for a product that places music at its core is exactly the kind of challenge I am seeking.

My background as an AI software developer centers on machine learning, Python programming, and automation. Over the past several years, I have built and deployed machine learning models, primarily focusing on large language models, fine-tuning, and prompt engineering. My experience includes integrating AI systems with robust backend services, developing APIs, and ensuring smooth data flows using REST APIs and JSON. I am comfortable working with cloud-based AI platforms like Azure OpenAI, and have a strong track record in building and maintaining data pipelines for training and inference.

In addition to backend expertise, I have experience creating user-facing tools and GUIs, always with an emphasis on usability and clear user experience. I’m detail-oriented and enjoy collaborating with cross-functional teams to ensure that technical solutions align with product goals. My work has often involved bridging the gap between research and production, and I appreciate Soundtrack’s mission-driven approach to striking the right balance between innovation and practical delivery.

While my primary experience is in text, image, and audio AI tasks, I am eager to deepen my knowledge in music technology and contribute to the ongoing development of music features at Soundtrack. I am motivated by environments that value curiosity, collaboration, and practical problem-solving—qualities that clearly resonate throughout your team.

I would welcome the chance to discuss how my background in AI and machine learning can support Soundtrack’s mission to deliver exceptional music experiences. I am available for interviews at your earliest convenience and look forward to learning more about your team.
